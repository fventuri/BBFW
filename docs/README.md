## Overview of the x6100's hardware and software
The Xiegu x6100 is a portable 10W (5W on battery power) 'all-mode' SDR transceiver designed for amatuer use.  Thanks to analysis of [high-resolution photos](https://github.com/TemporarilyOffline/X6100-TOADs) of the radio internals and previous work on other Xiegu radios, we know that the radio consists of a "Display Unit" ("front end") and a "Base Unit" ("back end" / "baseband"), which are analagous to a Raspberry Pi tablet duct taped on top of an FT-871's control panel.
 - The x6100's DispUnit is the Raspberry Pi tablet in our analogy: The DispUnit controls software for the LCD GUI/display and for audio interpretation (aka modems).  The Display Unit is run by an onboard ARM Cortex-A7 single-board-computer ("SBC"), a [MYZR Allwinner R16 CB166](https://www.myzr-tech.com/system-on-module/allwinner-som/r16-cpu-module.html).  This ARM SBC has its own operating system, which consists of Linux firmware (with proprietary display driver and many opensource drivers) and a Linux U-boot bootloader.  The DispUnit SBC's firmware has been thoroughly [reverse engineered](https://github.com/AetherRadio/awesome-x6100) by [Strijar (R1CBU)](https://r1cbu.ru/), LordKalma (CT7ALW), and others.  The reverse engineered frontend can run audio modems to decode/encode CW, RTTY, FT8, and others, self-contained within the x6100.
 - The x6100's BaseUnit is the FT-817's control panel in our analogy: The BaseUnit can be thought of as the 'actual radio' - or the simple control panel of the radio - which controls the sending/recieving of radio & audio signals from the radio's hardware devices.  The Base Unit is run by an onboard [STMicroelectronics STM32F427ZGT6](https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32f427zg.html), which is a 32-bit ARM [Cortex-M4](https://developer.arm.com/Processors/Cortex-M4) system-on-chip ("SoC").  The STM32F4 uses [little-endian](https://www.st.com/resource/en/programming_manual/pm0214-stm32-cortexm4-mcus-and-mpus-programming-manual-stmicroelectronics.pdf#page=34) formatting, has a well-documented [memory map](https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/stm32f427zg.pdf#page=86), [vector table (p36)](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/dui0553/b/?lang=en), and [opensource libraries](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/STM32CubeF4) for many functions.  Xiegu's STM32 firmware is sometimes referred to as "G-Core" firmware since the Xiegu G90 & G106 radios are also built around this frontend SBC / backend STM32 SoC model and are also controlled by similar STM32 firmware.  The G90 has been extensively researched & reversed and the tools created for it can be used to help reverse engineer the x6100.  The TYT MD-380 is a handheld UHF radio which is also controlled by an STM32 which has also been [reverse engineered](https://github.com/angea/pocorgtfo/blob/master/contents/issue10.pdf#page=76) by [Travis Goodspeed (KK4VCZ)](https://github.com/travisgoodspeed/md380tools).  The STM32 base unit (aka 'baseband') firmware, which sits at address 0x08020000 inside flash memory, is different than the STM32 base unit bootloader, which probably sits near 0x08000000 in flash memory.  The STM32 has [readout protection](https://stm32world.com/wiki/STM32_Readout_Protection_(RDP)) (also see [1](https://www.st.com/resource/en/product_training/STM32F7_Security_Memories_Protections.pdf), [2](https://www.st.com/content/ccc/resource/technical/document/application_note/group1/5f/8e/48/4c/1f/e1/41/0f/DM00684243/files/DM00684243.pdf/jcr:content/translations/en.DM00684243.pdf), [3](https://www.st.com/content/ccc/resource/technical/document/application_note/group1/9f/0b/e4/b6/75/15/4f/e2/DM00493651/files/DM00493651.pdf/jcr:content/translations/en.DM00493651.pdf)) which will erase both the bootloader & firmware if tripped incorrectly.

## Obtaining a x6100 Base Unit STM32 firmware file
The x6100's STM32 base unit _bootloader file_ can only be extracted from a radio unit.  However, the STM32 base unit firmware file can be easily extracted from official firmware updates - downloadable directly from [Radioddity](https://www.radioddity.com/pages/xiegu-download), which sells the x6100.  Inside compressed firmware update archive, you can find the x6100 STM32 base unit firmware file in either `Xiegu_X6100_Firmware_Upgrade_20221124.zip/Firmware/sdcard_20221124.img/1.img/usr/firmware/X6100_BBFW_V1.1.6_221112001.xgf` or `Xiegu_X6100_Firmware_Upgrade_20221124.zip/Firmware/sdcard_20221124.img/2.fat/rootfs.tar/./usr/firmware/X6100_BBFW_V1.1.6_221112001.xgf`.  The firmware file is encrypted with an AES-256 key (you will either need to find the key online or extract the key from your radio following the _"Bootloader extraction procedure from Xiegu G90 processors"_ article above).  Once you have the key, you will be able to decrypt 'X6100_BBFW_V1.1.6_221112001.xgf' (for example) using [G90 Tools](https://github.com/OpenHamradioFirmware/G90Tools).  Firmware CRC's are [available here](x6100_firmware_hashes.csv) for reference.

_Identifying project scope, ideas for automating/helping function discovery (the c compiler might have clumped functions in the same library together in memory, referencing opensource libraries), labeling functions according to guesses (`function_g`) or facts (`function_f`), using emulation to test RE hypothesis without needing hardware, keeping information in text files (track guesses/facts, who added, who last modified) and scripts instead of decompiler databases for portability/collaboration & version control, collaborators can work with their own favorite decompilers. "Have scripts to parse all of your data and keep everything in flat text files so that you can rebuild it in a new reverse engineering tomorrow if you have to."_
